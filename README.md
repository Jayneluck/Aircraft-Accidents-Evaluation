# Aircraft accidents evaluation
---
**Author**: Jane Bahati

## **Overview**
---
The goal of this evaluation is to aid the company in making informed decisions on the suitable aircraft model to procure as it ventures into both commercial and private aviation enterprises.  At the inception of this project, it is essential not only to assess the cost-benefit factors but also the operational risks in the aviation industry. Different aircraft models will be evaluated for there safety and reliability history

## **Objectives**
---
This evaluation project will cover the following objectives:

i.	To analyze data entailing aircraft models safety metrics and reliability indicators.

ii.	To establish the lowest-risk aircraft model through comparative evaluation.

iii.	To formulate realistic recommendations in line with the company’s interests.

## **Background Information**
The company is interested in diversifying its business venture through investing in the aviation sector, both commercial and private enterprises. The company’s interests are detracted by limited expertise and knowledge on risks in the field of aviation. This has hindered expansion and diversification process compelling a low-risk analysis on different aircraft model to be conducted. 


## **Data and Methods**
---
●In order to address the business questions above, secondary data was gathered from different sources including the safety records on aircraft accidents and incidents, manufacturers’ manuals and various model manufacturer reports. The safety record and reports were obtained from the accidents and incidents databases of Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and National Transport and Safety Board (NTSB). 



## **Results**
---

Aircrafts with reciprocating engines had the highest number of accidents.

Most accidents occurred when the weather was good and visibility was clear.

There has been a steady decrease of the number of accidents over the years which indicates improvements in safety in the aviation industry." generate a summary of next steps

## **Conclusions**
---

1. **High Accident Rates in Reciprocating Engine Aircraft**: Aircraft with reciprocating engines exhibit the highest number of accidents, suggesting that these aircraft types may require further safety enhancements, better maintenance practices, or updated operational guidelines.

2. **Accidents in Good Weather Conditions**: The occurrence of most accidents during good weather and clear visibility indicates that external environmental factors are not the primary cause. This highlights the potential significance of human error, technical failures, or procedural deficiencies as key contributing factors.

3. **Improvement in Aviation Safety Over Time**: The steady decline in accident rates over the years is a positive indicator of advancements in aviation technology, stricter safety regulations, and improved training practices within the industry.



## **Next Steps**
---


1. **Investigate Accidents with Reciprocating Engines**:
   - Conduct in-depth studies to understand why reciprocating engine aircraft have the highest accident rates.
   - Explore potential technical or operational upgrades for such aircraft.

2. **Analyze Accidents in Good Weather**:
   - Examine factors contributing to accidents during good weather conditions, such as human error, operational practices, or equipment failures.
   - Implement focused training programs for pilots to reduce errors under seemingly safe conditions.

3. **Enhance Safety Standards**:
   - Build on the improvements already made by identifying key interventions that led to the decrease in accident rates.
   - Continue refining aviation safety protocols and monitoring systems to sustain and enhance this trend.

4. **Data Collection and Monitoring**:
   - Expand data collection to identify more granular trends and causal factors.
   - Utilize advanced analytics or machine learning for predictive safety measures.
